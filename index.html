			<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>I'm a first-year Multimedia Production student focused on photography and cinematography. In my spare time, I love to be out at car meets taking photos/short videos to hone my skills with a camera. I've always loved the way a photo can be transformed through editing in Lightroom, going from flat and bland to sharp and moody. I can also be found donating My gift to My City Care and Coalbanks Creative Inc. I loves all kinds of music but canâ€™t stand country music. I tend to listen to music the most when I go for night drives in my 1990.5 Mazda Miata.
						<br>
						Ever since I was a child, I have had a love for the <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Lord of the Rings</a> and <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a>. During the winter months I like to spend my days up on the mountainside bombing the hills on my snowboard. I'm by no means an amazing rider but through a twisted knee and a concussion I have learned not to fall as much. 
I was born in Victoria, British Colombia, but moved around a lot between Victoria and Lethbridge, Alberta. Home for me quickly became where my family was and less about a specific location.

					<p>What started as a very small interest in automotive photography has quickly turned into a full-fledged passion for all things photography. I started my journey into photography around October of 2021. I would go to my local car meet and follow my friend around with his camera taking pictures of all the sweet cars. I was just fascinated with how a good photo can change they way you look at something. The creative expression with photography is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I ended up getting myself a camera and just wandering around the city looking for anything I could find that might make a cool photo. Photography has changed the way I look at my environment, there is so much beauty that goes unnoticed. My goal is to capture as much of that beauty as I can and express it in my own style.</p>
